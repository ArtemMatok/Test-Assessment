# TaxiTrips ETL Project
## About project
The goal of this task is to implement a simple ETL project in CLI that inserts data from a CSV into a single, flat table.

## Appsetings.json/duplicates.csv
Test-Assessment/ETL/ETL/bin/Debug/net8.0

## Deliverables

### 1. SQL Scripts
SQL scripts for creating the database and tables can be found in the `SqlScripts` folder.

### 2. Number of Rows
Number of rows in the table after running the program: **29041**.

### 3.  Assume your program will be used on much larger data files. Describe in a few sentences what you would change if you knew it would be used for a 10GB CSV input file.

To handle a 10GB CSV file, I would implement chunk-based processing to read and process the file in smaller parts, avoiding loading it entirely into memory. I would also optimize database operations by using batch inserts and validate data in smaller subsets to ensure scalability. Additionally, Iâ€™d consider streaming data directly to the database or an intermediate storage system to minimize memory usage during processing.
